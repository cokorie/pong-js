# PONG

### __Welcome to PONG__
Enjoy a recreation of the classic arcade game PONG, with scoring for 2 seperate players.

The desktop up & down arrows are used to control player 1's up & down movements, while left & right are used to control player 2's up & down movements in the game.

A game reset button is also available for resetting the game score for starting over a match.


Have fun playing this version of PONG!
